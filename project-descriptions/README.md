### Background

Access to antiretroviral therapy for HIV treatment has increased dramatically across the world in recent years. This has led to significant improvements in health and quality of life among people living with HIV. Despite these overall gains, individuals from marginalized communities continue to face significant social and economic barriers to receiving high quality HIV care. In particular, people who are food insecure and/or malnourished have consistently been shown to experience poor HIV outcomes under standard HIV care models. In India, prior studies have shown that rural women living with HIV are a highly vulnerable group with high prevalence of food insecurity and poverty. They are poorly served by the current HIV care system, leading to poorly controlled HIV disease and high case fatality rates. 

### Study Design and Data

The Asha-Nutrition program was a multi-institution intervention trial that evaluated an integrated HIV and nutrition care delivery model in a two-by-two factorial quasi-experimental design. This program enrolled 600 women living with HIV in rural Andhra Pradesh, India. Four study arms included: 1) standard supportive care delivered by a trained community health worker (called ASHA) (SC); 2) SC + nutrition education (+NE); 3) SC + nutrition supplements (+NS); or 4) SC + nutrition education and nutrition supplements (+NENS). The outcomes were immune competency measure by CD4 counts and body mass index (BMI). Assessments occurred at baseline, and months 6 (immediately post-intervention), 12, and 18. The study was conducted during 2014 – 2019. During the course of follow-up, Program 4 (+NENS) experienced greatest improvements in CD4 counts compared to Program 1 (+SE) for both outcomes. Programs 2 and 3 also generated higher improvements in the outcomes compared to Program 1. The results of this trial were shared with the National AIDS Control Organization of the Indian Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. 

### Objective

Nutritional programs are now an integral part of HIV care in India. While the trial successfully showed strong effects of an integrated HIV and nutritional care model among women living with HIV in India, the beneficial gains in the outcomes were heterogeneous. From a programmatic perspective, it is important to understand why some groups of individuals had lower levels of improvements than others. Identifying demographic and psychosocial characteristics of study participants who might benefit from additional support could further improve the effectiveness of HIV and nutritional care delivery programs. The objective of the Asha-Nutrition secondary analysis project is to identify baseline predictors of improvements in HIV and nutritional outcomes among women living with HIV in rural India who participated in the Asha-Nutrition trial.

### Background

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most prevalent and fatal malignancies globally, ranking as the second most common cancer in women and the third most common in men. Its widespread impact on human health and life makes it a significant public health concern. Despite substantial advances in cancer research and treatment, there remains an urgent demand for reliable biomarkers to enhance CRC screening, surveillance, and therapy monitoring. Traditional diagnostic methods have limitations in sensitivity and specificity, underscoring the need for novel approaches. Notably, cancer patients frequently exhibit altered or abnormal metabolism, indicating the potential utility of metabolic biomarkers for CRC. The link between cancer and altered metabolism has been a subject of intense scientific interest, and studying metabolic biomarkers for CRC could lead to new insights applicable to broader cancer research.

### Study Design and Data

A study measured 158 targeted metabolites from 25 potentially significant metabolic pathways in 234 serum samples (Chen et al. 2017). These samples were collected from three groups: 66 CRC patients, 76 polyp patients (polyp is a benign status), and 92 healthy controls. In addition, some clinical or demographic variables were collected such as age, gender, weight, height, smoking, and alcohol status.

### Objectives

The primary objective of this research project is to explore the utility of metabolic profiling in differentiating colorectal cancer patients from healthy controls. While initial analyses have shown promise, the complexity of metabolic data analysis poses significant challenges. Two critical issues arise: (1) the presence of outliers and undetected levels, and (2) the inherently high-dimensional and multivariate nature of metabolic data, which may be confounded by demographic factors affecting colorectal cancer risk. This study aims to investigate the impact of these practical issues on the interpretation of metabolic measurements in the context of colorectal cancer, and how to address these issues in statistically and scientifically meaningful ways. Additionally, the research aims to explore how targeted multivariate analysis of metabolic pathways can enhance the efficiency of statistical modeling, potentially leading to more accurate and reliable diagnostic and prognostic tools for colorectal cancer.
