### Background

Access to antiretroviral therapy for HIV treatment has increased dramatically across the world in recent years. This has led to significant improvements in health and quality of life among people living with HIV. Despite these overall gains, individuals from marginalized communities continue to face significant social and economic barriers to receiving high quality HIV care. In particular, people who are food insecure and/or malnourished have consistently been shown to experience poor HIV outcomes under standard HIV care models. In India, prior studies have shown that rural women living with HIV are a highly vulnerable group with high prevalence of food insecurity and poverty. They are poorly served by the current HIV care system, leading to poorly controlled HIV disease and high case fatality rates. 

### Study Design and Data

The Asha-Nutrition program was a multi-institution intervention trial that evaluated an integrated HIV and nutrition care delivery model in a two-by-two factorial quasi-experimental design. This program enrolled 600 women living with HIV in rural Andhra Pradesh, India. Four study arms included: 1) standard supportive care delivered by a trained community health worker (called ASHA) (SC); 2) SC + nutrition education (+NE); 3) SC + nutrition supplements (+NS); or 4) SC + nutrition education and nutrition supplements (+NENS). The outcomes were immune competency measure by CD4 counts and body mass index (BMI). Assessments occurred at baseline, and months 6 (immediately post-intervention), 12, and 18. The study was conducted during 2014 – 2019. During the course of follow-up, Program 4 (+NENS) experienced greatest improvements in CD4 counts compared to Program 1 (+SE) for both outcomes. Programs 2 and 3 also generated higher improvements in the outcomes compared to Program 1. The results of this trial were shared with the National AIDS Control Organization of the Indian Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. 

### Objective

Nutritional programs are now an integral part of HIV care in India. While the trial successfully showed strong effects of an integrated HIV and nutritional care model among women living with HIV in India, the beneficial gains in the outcomes were heterogeneous. From a programmatic perspective, it is important to understand why some groups of individuals had lower levels of improvements than others. Identifying demographic and psychosocial characteristics of study participants who might benefit from additional support could further improve the effectiveness of HIV and nutritional care delivery programs. The objective of the Asha-Nutrition secondary analysis project is to identify baseline predictors of improvements in HIV and nutritional outcomes among women living with HIV in rural India who participated in the Asha-Nutrition trial.
