## About you: what you may [like]{.medium-green} about writing

<br>

-   ***making** the analyzed data to **look easy**.*

<br>

-   *I liked the puzzle of structuring the report and figuring out the best way to **tell a story***

<br>

-   *It's satisfying to be able to present research to others. There isn't much **point to research** without sharing it.*

## About you: what you may [dislike]{.maroon} about writing

<br>

-   *Not sure what is important, and which one is not. **What to include or not***

<br>

-   *Figuring out **where to start** and **formatting***

<br>

-   *I **don't think I'm very good at writing**, and thus I can sometimes iterate too many times over my work and obsess over making it better*

## About this workshop

<br> 

-   **What we will learn**: writing a data analysis (DA) report

    -   USRESP competition guidelines

    -   writing papers in RStudio + references management

<br> 

-   **How we will learn**\

    {{< fa circle-question >}} Asking ourselves questions (e.g. why we like/dislike a title)

# DA Report: *Big* picture

## DA report [VS.]{.maroon} Creative Writing

. . .

::: {.callout-warning icon="false"}
## [{{< fa circle-question >}} Question]{.black}

How is a DA report different from creative writing?
:::

-   There is a lot of **structure**

. . .

> *"It felt very straight forward \[...\] as in there seemed to be a set of common things people did in data analysis reports that you just needed to do"*
>
> (From one of your responses to *What did you like of writing the report?*)

-   There are **bricks** to build with
    -   They are determined by your research project. e.g., figures, tables, previous research findings

. . .

{{< fa smile >}} You don't really start from a blank page

. . .

{{< fa meh >}} Not a ton of room for creativity\
*"The writing in data analysis reports often feels very clinical and boring"*

## Types of DA report

USRESP identifies 2 main types of projects:

-   [application]{.medium-green} focused

-   [methodology]{.orange} focused (i.e. focused on the properties of a statistical method)

. . .

::: {.callout-tip icon="false"}
## [{{< fa feather >}} Practice]{.black}

Can you tell the type from the title of past USRESP submissions?

-   *Performance of LDA And QDA On Non-Normally Distributed Predictors*

    -   [methodology]{.orange}

-   *Spatial Modeling Of Bird Populations Using Citizen Science Data*

    -   [application]{.medium-green}

-   *Behind The Smoke: An Extreme Value Analysis Of Air Pollution In Minnesota*

    -   [application]{.medium-green}

## A good DA report

::: {.callout-warning icon="false"}
## [{{< fa circle-question >}} Question]{.black}

What makes for a good DA report?
:::

-   It is clear and easy to read

-   It tells an interesting story

-   It makes a good statistical analysis and explains the results well

## [{{< fa circle-question >}} Question]{.black}

**Why** do we write a DA report?
:::

-   To let **someone else** learn about:

    -   an interesting problem (that they might not know)

    -   ways to approach the problem (that they might not know!)

    -   what results one gets when they approach the problem in these ways

    -   what insights these results tell us (and how they relate to other insights that people could read elsewhere)

Guess what makes for a good introduction according to USRESP judging criteria?
:::

-   Does the background and significance have a **logical organization**? Does it move from the **general to the specific**?

-   Has **sufficient background** been provided **to understand** the paper? How does this work **relate to other work** in the scientific literature?

-   Has a reasonable explanation been given for why the research was done? **Why is the work important?** Why is it relevant?

-   Does this section end with **statements about the hypothesis/goals** of the paper?

## Methods

What should be included (according to USRESP template):

-   **Data collection**\
    Explain how the data was collected/experiment was conducted. Additionally, you should provide information on the individuals who participated to assess representativeness. Non-response rates and other relevant data collection details should be mentioned here if they are an issue. However, you should not discuss the impact of these issues here - save that for the limitations section.

-   **Variable creation**\
    Detail the variables in your analysis and how they are defined (if necessary). For example, if you created a combined (frequency times quantity) drinking variable you should describe how. If you are talking about gender no further explanation is really needed.

-   **Analytic Methods**\
    Explain the statistical procedures that will be used to analyze your data. E.g. Boxplots are used to illustrate differences in GPA across gender and class standing. Correlations are used to assess the impacts of gender and class standing on GPA.

## Methods

::: {.callout-warning icon="false"}
## [{{< fa circle-question >}} Question]{.black}

Guess what makes for a good method section according to USRESP judging criteria?
:::

-   Could the study be **repeated** based on the information given here? Is the material organized into logical categories \[like the ones in the previous slide\]?

## Results

How USRESP guidelines suggest to frame the results section:


-   typically, results sections **start with descriptive statistics**


-   information presented must be relevant in helping to answer the research question(s) of interest


-   typically, **inferential** (i.e. hypothesis tests) **statistics come next**.


-   **Tables and figures** are useful in this section and should be labeled, embedded in the text, and **referenced appropriately**.

. . .

And here are the USRESP assessment questions:

-   Is the content appropriate for a results section? Is there a clear description of the results?

-   Are the results/data analyzed well? Given the data in each figure/table is the interpretation accurate and logical? Is the analysis of the data thorough (anything ignored?)

-   Are the figures/tables appropriate for the data being discussed? Are the figure legends and titles clear and concise?

## Results

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
## [{{< fa eye >}} Example]{.black}

Let's read this snippet together

(From the Results section in *Psychiatric Comorbidity In Opioid Use Treatment Outcomes* by Linda Tang, winner at 2021 Fall USRESP)
:::

> Addressing our primary analysis, we observed that having psychiatric comorbidity is associated with higher incidence of treatment dropout and lower incidence of treatment completion. More specifically, holding all else constant, a client with psychiatric comorbidity is expected to have 1.05 times the subdistribution hazard of dropping out of the treatment and 0.91 times the subdistribution hazard of completing a treatment compared to a client without psychiatric comorbidity. Although the effect size of this association is modest, it still highlights that the current treatment programs need to better accommodate the special needs of this subgroup of clients.

Can you guess:

-   one thing that I like about the snippet

-   two things that I think could be improved
:::

## Discussion

Here are the USRESP assessment criteria:

-   Does the author clearly state whether the results answer the question (support or disprove the hypothesis)?

-   Were specific data cited from the results to support each interpretation? Does the author clearly articulate the basis for supporting or rejecting each hypothesis?

-   Does the author adequately relate the results of the current work to previous research?

## Abstract

::: {.callout-warning icon="false"}
## [{{< fa circle-question >}} Question]{.black}

What is an abstract?
:::

. . .

> The abstract provides a brief summary of the entire paper (background, methods, results and conclusions). The suggested length is no more than 150 words. This allows you **approximately 1 sentence (and likely no more than two sentences) summarizing each of the following sections**. Typically, abstracts are the last thing you write.

**Assessment**: Are the main points of the paper described clearly and succinctly?

## Abstract

From *Investigation Of NCAA Basketball's Three Point Strategy Using Logistic Mixed Effects Regression Model* by (Che Hoon Jeong, winner of 2022 Fall USRESP):

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
## [{{< fa eye >}} Example]{.black}

Several studies have presented the increase of three point shot attempts and its significance in winning games in the National Basketball Association (NBA). However, there are limited quantitative research on whether collegiate basketball reflects the three-point strategy of the NBA. This paper conducts a Seasonal Mann-Kendall test to present a statistically significant increase in three-point shot distance in NCAA Division 1 basketball, which reflects the trend of the NBA. The Logistic Mixed Effects Regression reveals that each three-point attempt decreases the probability of winning on average, whereas a made three-point shot increases the probability of winning the most out of the sixteen variables used in the model. Thus, designating three-point shots primarily for efficient three-point shooters may increase the chances of winning. Nevertheless, drafting sharpshooters and developing three-point shooting skills may benefit teams in the long-run, who may capitalize on the impact of successful three-point shots.
