------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Background

-   Colorectal cancer (CRC) is among the most common (2nd in women and 3rd in men) and deadly cancers worldwide.

-   Despite advances, there's a pressing need for robust biomarkers to improve CRC screening, surveillance, and therapy monitoring.

-   Cancer patients often show altered / abnormal metabolism.

-   A study monitored 158 **targeted** metabolites from 25 potentially significant metabolic pathways in 234 serum samples. These samples were collected from three patient groups: 66 CRC patients, 76 polyp patients (polyp is a benign status), and 92 healthy controls [@Zhu2014].

## Background [@Zhu2014]

-   Partial least-squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) models were used to distinguish CRC patients from both healthy controls and polyp patients. The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves based on these PLS-DA models indicated

    -   high sensitivity: 0.96 for differentiating CRC patients from healthy controls; and 0.89 for from poly patients

    -   good specificity: 0.80 and 0.88

    -   excellent areas under the curve: 0.93 and 0.95

# Data Exploration

## Read data

A useful website about reading data from excel

<http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/reading-data-from-excel-files-xls-xlsx-into-r>

```{r}
#| results: hide

#install.packages("readxl")
# Load the library 
library("readxl")
library("tidyr")
library("ggplot2")
crc <- read_excel("CRC raw data_ updated with patient ID.xlsx", sheet = "Sheet1", na=c("NA", "-"))
attributes(crc)
crc <- as.data.frame(crc)
```

## Explore the Data

1.  Examine the data dimension and names

    ```{r}
    #| code-fold: true
    #| results: hide

    dim(crc)
    names(crc)
    ```

2.  Check the first column

    ```{r}
    #| code-fold: true

    #column 1 is the Group indicator: C, H, or P
    table(crc$Groups)
    ```

## 

3.  Check the second column

    ```{r}
    #| code-fold: true

    #column 2 is the patient ID
    crc$`Patient   ID` %>% unique %>% length
    ```

4.  Columns 3-115 are metabolism variables. We will check the first nine by drawing their histograms

    ```{r}
    #| code-fold: true

    par(mfrow=c(3,3))
    for(i in 1:9)
      hist(crc[,2+i]) 

    #change the range of i to draw other ones
    j=7
    par(mfrow=c(3,3))
    for(i in (9*j-8):(9*j))
      hist(log(crc[,2+i]), main=paste(i))

    ```

## 

5.  Characteristics of a metabolism

    ```{r}
    #| code-fold: true

    #mean, SD, skewness, 
    #stratified by group
    ```

6.  Columns 116-124 (clinical variables)

    ```{r}
    names(crc[,116:124])
    colnames(crc)[116:124]=c('age', 'gender', 'smoking', 'alcohol', 'diagnosis', 
                           'stage', 'height', 'weight', 'bmi')

    ```

## 

Examine missing data. What is the missing mechanism? Are the undetected values really undetected or missing values? What way makes more sense?

```{r}
i=56; j=57
ggplot(crc, aes(x=log(crc[,i+2]), y=log(crc[,j+2]), color=Groups))+
  geom_point()
```

# Scientific Questions

-   In the healthy population,

    -   the metabolisms are associated with which clinical / demographic variables?

-   Which metabolisms are different between

    -   healthy and cancer subjects?

    -   healthy and polyp subjects?

    -   polyp and cancer subjects?

    -   between the two subtypes of cancer?

-   Do different group have the same metabolite correlation structure?

-   Missing data treatment: should the "1"s be replaced by "NA"? If we do so, can we improve "the results"?

-   Use nested CV to correct the bias in predictive accuracy

-   ...

# How to read a research paper?

Main takeaways

1.  **Strategic Reading:** Reading a scientific paper should not be a linear process (from beginning to end). Instead, it requires a strategic approach that goes beyond a surface-level understanding.

2.  **Critical Mindset:** Adopt a critical mindset while reading. Challenge the findings and question your understanding to deepen your comprehension of the content.

3.  **Fluid Navigation:** It's okay to navigate backwards and forwards through the paper. Scientific literature often requires revisiting sections to fully grasp complex ideas and information.

## 

4.  **Note-taking:** Keeping notes is a crucial part of the reading process. Notes will help synthesize information, identify important points, and assist in your comprehension and recall of key findings.

5.  **Multi-tab Browsing:** To comprehend the full depth of a scientific paper, often you'll need to have multiple tabs open in your browser for cross-referencing, fact-checking, and understanding contextual and background information.

Use  [@Zhu2014] as an example. 


## Step1: SKIM to find the big picture

![](images/image-1054719093.png)

Big picture:

-   Based on the title, the article offers a screening method for colorectal cancer by using targeted serum metabolic profiling.

-   The abstract told us that colorectal cancer imposes serious public health burden and the screening method introduced by the article has very satisfactory results. The main statistical method seems to be the partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA)

## Step2: RE-READ

![](images/image-859473957.png)

-   What problem is the study trying to solve? **A**: providing a new screening test for colorectal cancer because existing ones are not accurate, invasive, or expensive.

-   Are the findings well supported by evidence? **A**: yes. The new approach (metabolic profiling + PLS-DA) has high sensitivity, good specificity, and excellent areas under the curve.

-   Are the findings unique and supported by other work in the field? **A**:

## 

-   What was the sample size? Is it representative of the larger population? **A**: 66 CRC patients, 76 polyp patients, and 92 healthy controls. Patients were age- and gender-matched in each group. The sample is not a representative sample of the larger population.

-   Is the study repeatable? **A**: not sure about scientifically. Since the data is available, we can check whether similar results can be obtained.

-   What factors might affect the results? **A**: The authors detected 112 metabolisms from 158 targeted ones due to QC filtering. QC might be an issue.
