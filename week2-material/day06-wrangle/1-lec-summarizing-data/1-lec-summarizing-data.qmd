## Review

**mean** : average of a list of data values 
$$\bar x = \frac{\Sigma_{i = 1}^{n} x_i}{n}$$

**median**: the middle value when the data are ordered

##

**sample variance**: average square distance from the mean. It measures variability of the data.
$$s^2 = \frac{\Sigma_{i = 1}^{n} (x_i - \bar x )^2}{n-1}$$


**sample standard deviation**: average distance of a data value from the mean. Square root of the variance. 

$$s = \sqrt{s^{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{\Sigma_{i = 1}^{n} (x_i - \bar x )^2}{n-1}}$$



## Mean

**mean** : average of a list of data values 
$$\bar x = \frac{\Sigma_{i = 1}^{n} x_i}{n}$$



```{r}
summarize(fastfood, 
          mean(calories))
```



```{r}
mean(fastfood$calories)
```



## Median

**median**: the middle value when the data are ordered


```{r}
summarize(fastfood, 
          median(calories))
```




```{r}
median(fastfood$calories)
```



## Variance

**sample variance**: average square distance from the mean. It measures variability of the data.
$$s^2 = \frac{\Sigma_{i = 1}^{n} (x_i - \bar x )^2}{n-1}$$

```{r}
summarize(fastfood, 
          var(calories))
```




```{r}
var(fastfood$calories)
```


## Standard Deviation
**sample standard deviation**: average distance of a data value from the mean. Square root of the variance. 
$$s = \sqrt{s^{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{\Sigma_{i = 1}^{n} (x_i - \bar x )^2}{n-1}}$$

```{r}
summarize(fastfood, 
          sd(calories))
```




```{r}
sd(fastfood$calories)
```


## Minimum


```{r}
summarize(fastfood, 
          min(calories))
```




```{r}
min(fastfood$calories)
```



## Maximum


```{r}
summarize(fastfood, 
          max(calories))
```




```{r}
max(fastfood$calories)
```



We can use multiple functions inside `summarize()`. 

```{r}
summarize(fastfood, 
          mean(calories), 
          median(calories),
          var(calories),
          sd(calories),
          min(calories),
          max(calories))
```



We can use create variable names for the output (e.g. `mean_cal`). 

```{r}
summarize(fastfood, 
          mea_cal = mean(calories), 
          med_cal = median(calories),
          var_cal = var(calories),
          sd_cal = sd(calories),
          min_cal = min(calories),
          max_cal = max(calories))
```

Three solutions to a single problem

:::

##

What is the average of 4, 8, 16 approximately?

. . .

1.What is the average of **4, 8, 16** approximately?

. . .

2.What is the **average** of 4, 8, 16 approximately?

3.What is the average of 4, 8, 16 **approximately**?

Solution 1: Functions within Functions

:::


```{r}
c(4, 8, 16)
```

. . .

<hr>

```{r}
mean(c(4, 8, 16))
```



<hr>

```{r}
round(mean(c(4, 8, 16)))
```

##

**Problem with writing functions within functions**

Things will get messy and more difficult to read and debug as we deal with more complex operations on data.

##

:::{.font75}

Solution 2: Creating Objects

:::


##

```{r}
numbers <- c(4, 8, 16)
numbers
```

. . .

<hr>

```{r}
avg_number <- mean(numbers)
avg_number
```

. . .

<hr>

```{r}
round(avg_number)
```

##

**Problem with creating many objects**

We will end up with too many objects in `Environment`.

Solution 3: The (forward) Pipe Operator %>% 

:::

##

:::{.font75}

Shortcut: <br>Ctrl (Command) + Shift + M

:::

##

```{r}
c(4, 8, 16) %>% 
  mean() %>% 
  round()
```


Combine 4, 8, and 16 `and then`  
Take the mean   `and then`  
Round the output



##

The output of the first function is the first argument of the second function.

##

Do you recall composite functions such as $f \circ g(x)$?

. . .

Now we have $f \circ g \circ h (x)$ or `round(mean(c(4, 8, 16)))`

. . .



```{r eval = FALSE}
h(x) %>% 
  g() %>% 
  f()
```



```{r eval = FALSE}
c(4, 8, 16) %>% 
  mean() %>% 
  round()
```

##


We can use the pipe operator with the `summarize()` function. 

```{r}
summarize(fastfood, 
          mea_cal = mean(calories), 
          med_cal = median(calories),
          var_cal = var(calories),
          sd_cal = sd(calories),
          min_cal = min(calories),
          max_cal = max(calories))
```

##

We so far have been summarizing data numerically. 
In grouped data, we often want to do this for each group (e.g. left vs. right handed people, first-years vs. sophomores vs. juniors vs. seniors. etc.).

##

`group_by()`

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/data-wrangle.003.jpeg")
```

`group_by()` separates the data frame by the groups. Any action following `group_by()` will be completed for each group separately.


##

Notice that the output indicates `Groups:   restaurant [8]`

```{r}
fastfood %>% 
  group_by(restaurant)
```


##

```{r}
fastfood %>% 
  group_by(restaurant) %>% 
  summarize(med_calories = median(calories),
            mean_calories = mean(calories))
```
