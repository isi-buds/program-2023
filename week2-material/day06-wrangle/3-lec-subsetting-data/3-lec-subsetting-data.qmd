## subsetting variables/columns

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="80%"}

```

. . .

`select()`



## subsetting observations/rows

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/data-wrangle.002.jpeg")
```

`slice()` and `filter()` 

##

`select` is used to select certain variables in the data frame. 



```{r}
select(ca_covid_hosp, county, todays_date,
       hospitalized_covid_confirmed_patients)
```


. . .

##

```{r}

ca_covid_hosp %>% 
  select(county, todays_date,
       hospitalized_covid_confirmed_patients)
```


##

`select` can also be used to drop certain variables if used with a negative sign.

```{r}
select(ca_covid_hosp, -all_hospital_beds,
       -icu_available_beds)
```



## Selection helpers

`starts_with()`  
`ends_with()`  
`contains()`  

##

```{r}
select(ca_covid_hosp, starts_with("hospitalized"))
```

##

```{r}
select(ca_covid_hosp, ends_with("covid_confirmed_patients"))
```

##

```{r}
select(ca_covid_hosp, contains("suspected"))

```



## subsetting variables/columns

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="80%"}

`select()`



## subsetting observations/rows

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/data-wrangle.002.jpeg")
```

`slice()` and `filter()` 

##


`slice()` subsetting rows based on a row number.

The data below include all the rows from third to seventh. Including third and seventh.

```{r}
slice(ca_covid_hosp, 3:7)
```




##

`filter()` subsetting rows based on a condition.

The data below includes rows corresponding to Orange county.


```{r}
filter(ca_covid_hosp, county == "Orange")
```

ca_covid_hosp %>% 
  filter(county == "Orange" & 
           hospitalized_covid_confirmed_patients > 2200)
```


##

```{r}
ca_covid_hosp %>% 
  filter(county=="Orange" & 
           hospitalized_covid_confirmed_patients>2200) %>% 
  nrow()
```

We have done all sorts of selections, slicing, filtering on `ca_covid_hosp` but it has not changed at all. Why do you think so?

```{r}
glimpse(ca_covid_hosp)

```
